/*
    Given a linked list as below with a loop. Detect it and remove it.

    Input linked list as below. 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 2
              5 <- 4
              |    ^
              v    |
         1 -> 2 -> 3
    The output linked list must be 1 -> 2 -> 3 ->4 -> 5

    Distance traveled by fast pointer = 2 * (Distance traveled  by slow pointer)
    (m + n*x + k) = 2*(m + n*y + k)
    m --> Distance of first node of the cycle from head.
    n - > Length of cycle
    k --> Distance of point where slow meets head from the first node of the cycle.
    Note that before meeting the point shown above, fast was moving at twice speed.
    x -->  Number of complete cyclic rounds made by fast pointer before they meet first time
    y -->  Number of complete cyclic rounds made by  slow pointer before they meet first time
    From above equation, we can conclude below
     m + k = (x-2y)*n
    Which means m+k is a multiple of n.

    Floydâ€™s Cycle detection algorithm terminates when fast and slow pointers meet at a common point.
